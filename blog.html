        <h2>Learn javascript in fun way!</h2>
        <br>
        <h5> var vs let vs const :</h5>
        <p>JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables: var, let, and const.

        var is function-scoped and can cause unexpected behavior due to hoisting.
        let and const are block-scoped and provide better control.

       const is used when the variable value should not be reassigned, while let is used when reassignment is needed.
       Using let and const helps write cleaner and more predictable JavaScript code.</p>

       <h4>Promises and Async/Await Explained :</h4>
       <p>Promises help handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
        They represent a value that will be available now, later, or never.
        Async/Await is a cleaner way to work with promises.
        It makes asynchronous code easier to read and maintain.
        Understanding async JavaScript is essential for building modern web applications.</p>
        <h5>Common JavaScript Mistakes</h5>
        <p>One common mistake is not understanding scope properly.
        Another mistake is ignoring error handling in asynchronous code.
        Using strict mode, writing clean functions, and understanding closures can prevent many bugs.
        Learning from mistakes is the fastest way to improve as a JavaScript developer.</p>
        <p>This blog is based on my learning and hands-on practice in JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Learning Problem Solving in Fun way!</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>My Journey into Programming</h4>
        <p>I started my programming journey with curiosity and a lot of confusion.  
        Initially, concepts like loops, arrays, and functions felt overwhelming.

        With consistent practice and problem-solving, I slowly started understanding how logic works in programming.  
        Platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks helped me improve my thinking and confidence.
        This journey taught me that consistency matters more than speed, and learning never really stops in tech.</p>
        <h4>What I Learned fromSolving DSA Problems</h4>
        <p>Solving DSA problems taught me how to think logically rather than jumping to solutions.  
        I learned how breaking a problem into smaller parts makes it easier to solve.

        Mistakes helped me understand edge cases and improve my approach.  
        Over time, my problem-solving speed and confidence improved significantly.

        DSA is not just for interviews, but for writing better and optimized code.</p>
